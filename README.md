# 👋 Hi, I’m Ben  

I’m a **software specialist transitioning into full-time development**, with 10+ years of Linux as my main OS and a passion for building—from **low-level bootloaders** in assembly to **cross-platform mobile apps** with Ionic and Capacitor.

## 🔹 My Edge  
I’ve lived on both sides of the stack: supporting complex systems in production *and* writing the code that powers them. That means I bring:  
- 🛠 **Practical debugging skills** from years in support  
- 🧩 **Systems understanding** from assembly and OS work  
- ⚡ **Modern app delivery** with Ionic/Capacitor  

---

## 🔹 Featured Projects  
- 📱 **Mobile Apps** – Cross-platform apps built with Ionic + Capacitor  
- 🧪 **Security Experiments** – Pen-testing write-ups, Hydra automation, IDA Pro reversals  
- 🎮 **Creative Hacks** – Lua mods for Mario 64 PC, Arduino projects, and small electronics builds  
- 🖥️ **Systems** – x86 bootloader building blocks from scratch
